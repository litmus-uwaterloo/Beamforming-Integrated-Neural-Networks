# Code Sample and Data
NOTE AS OF OCT 3, 2024: THE SCRIPTS WILL BE UPLOADED SHORTLY, PLEASE CHECK BACK AGAIN IN A FEW DAYS

The repository contains one [TensorFlow script](/example_TensorFlow.m) and one [PyTorch script](/example_PyTorch.m) containing the entirety of each example, alongside [shared data](/Data) to run sample training and inference steps. Please run either script for a demonstration of the simple convolutional neural network architecture.

These scripts have been tested using Tensorflow ver. 2.10.1, PyTorch ver. 2.0.0, and CUDA v11.2.
