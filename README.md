# Code Sample and Data
NOTE AS OF OCT 8, 2024: THE SCRIPTS WILL BE ON OR BEFORE OCT 21, 2024. WE APOLOGIZE FOR THE DELAY!

The repository contains one [TensorFlow script](/example_TensorFlow.m) and one [PyTorch script](/example_PyTorch.m) containing the entirety of each example, alongside [shared data](/Data) to run sample training and inference steps. Please run either script for a demonstration of the toy convolutional neural network architecture found in the corresponding paper.

These scripts have been tested using Tensorflow ver. 2.10.1, PyTorch ver. 2.0.0, and CUDA v11.2.
