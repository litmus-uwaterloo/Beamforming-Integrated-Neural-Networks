# Code Sample and Data
The repository contains one [TensorFlow script](/example_TensorFlow.m) and one [PyTorch script](/example_PyTorch.m) containing the entirety of each example, alongside [shared data](/Data) to run sample training and inference steps. Please run either script for a demonstration of the simple convolutional neural network architecture.
